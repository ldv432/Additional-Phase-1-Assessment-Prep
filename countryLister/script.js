// Problem: Rendering List in DOM
// Instructions:
// You have an array of country objects containing properties `name`, `population`, and `continent`.
// Render this list dynamically as list items on the webpage, displaying both the
// country name, its population, and additional information such as its flag and continent.
// Implement functionality to filter countries by continent and calculate the total population
// of the current list appended to the DOM.

// Provided Array:
const countries = [
    { name: 'USA', population: 328_200_000, continent: 'Americas' },
    { name: 'China', population: 1_394_015_977, continent: 'Asia' },
    { name: 'India', population: 1_366_417_754, continent: 'Asia' },
    { name: 'Brazil', population: 213_993_437, continent: 'Americas' },
    { name: 'Pakistan', population: 220_892_340, continent: 'Asia' },
    { name: 'Nigeria', population: 206_139_589, continent: 'Africa' },
    { name: 'Bangladesh', population: 164_689_383, continent: 'Asia' },
    { name: 'Russia', population: 145_934_462, continent: 'Europe' },
    { name: 'Mexico', population: 128_932_753, continent: 'Americas' },
    { name: 'Japan', population: 126_476_461, continent: 'Asia' },
];

// Write your code here to render the list of countries dynamically with additional information.

// Write your code here to implement functionality to filter countries by continent.

// Write your code here to implement functionality to calculate the total population of the current list appended to the DOM.
