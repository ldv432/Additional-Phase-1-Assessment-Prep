// Problem: Calculating Total Budget and Pay
// Instructions:
// You're managing a budget for different projects. Each project is represented as an object
// with properties `name`, `budget`, `team_size`, `hourly_pay`, and `hours_per_week`.
// Calculate the total budget across all projects and display it dynamically on the webpage.
// Additionally, calculate the total pay for each project per week based on the hourly pay and work hours per week.

// Provided Array:
const projects = [
    { name: 'Project A', budget: 10000, team_size: 5, hourly_pay: 25, hours_per_week: 40 },
    { name: 'Project B', budget: 20000, team_size: 8, hourly_pay: 30, hours_per_week: 35 },
    { name: 'Project C', budget: 15000, team_size: 4, hourly_pay: 20, hours_per_week: 45 },
    { name: 'Project D', budget: 18000, team_size: 6, hourly_pay: 28, hours_per_week: 40 },
    { name: 'Project E', budget: 22000, team_size: 7, hourly_pay: 26, hours_per_week: 40 },
    { name: 'Project F', budget: 25000, team_size: 5, hourly_pay: 32, hours_per_week: 35 },
